## Mimóza Memories

This is the public-facing website for Mimóza Memories, a small Hungarian business offering full wedding decorations, bridal bouquets, and table arrangements.
All the decorations are done by Liza, an architect who spent a year in Amsterdam learning how to arrange flowers and make decorations.
Her style is rustic, natural field bouquets, subtle, yet elegant and modern decorations.
Besides decorating weddings, she also holds creative workshops where the participants can make Christmas wreaths, small flower arrangements, and other DIY products.
She also plans to start a webshop with the custom-made decorations that can be tailored to the buyer's needs.

## Initial Cursor command

Build me a website for the business described in `.cursor/context.md`.
The style of the website should represent the style of the business (natural, elegant, modern).
The colors should be elegant but modest, and the feel of the website must be professional.
All the resources used by the website (images, logos, textual content) are under the `/resources` folder, grouped into subfolders by pages. These folders should roughly dictate the structure of the website as well.
All pages have a `texts.md` file with the textual content to be visible on the page.
Obey the coding guidelines in `.cursor/rules/coding-guideline.mdc`.
